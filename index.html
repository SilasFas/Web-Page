        <p>
            You probably know that the Android operating system maintained by Google is one of the most used for mobile
            devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story.
            Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The first version
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first attempt to come up with a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named Dan Morrill . He
            says he opened Inkscape (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The
            goal was just to personify the system only for his team, there was no request from the company to create a
            mascot.

            This terrible first version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.
        </p>
        <h3>
            A new mascot comes to the scene
        </h3>
        <p>
            The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian
            illustrator Irina Blok , also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more
            pleasant way.
        </p>
        <img src="#" alt="Android">
        <p>
            Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design
            should also bring quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the Bugdroid, the new mascot
            of Android.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate
            bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. People say that the artist was working at her desk in
            the Google office and looked at the restrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, straightforward,
            clear.

                    Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in
                    alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and
                    started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10 .
